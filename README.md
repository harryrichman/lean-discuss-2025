# Proofs as programs in Lean

This is the website for a discussion group on using Lean, held at [NCTS](https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/) in May-June 2025.


Lean is a programming language designed for writing mathematical proofs.
It allows the computer to help verify that your proof is correct.
In particular, writing a proof using Lean should "make it harder to prove things that are not true." (borrowing words from [Leslie Lamport](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11784-012-0071-6).)


For this discussion group, we will use code in [this github repository](https://github.com/harryrichman/glimpse-of-lean).


## Project topics

For details, see the [About](about/) section.

1. Newton's theorem on real roots

2. Cauchy interlacing theorem

3. Puiseux's theorem

4. Descartes's rule of signs

5. Sturm's theorem for polynomial roots

6. Newton's theorem for valued fields
