# Proofs as programs in Lean

This is the website for a discussion group on using Lean, held at [NCTS](https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/) in May-June 2025.

Lean is a programming language designed for writing mathematical proofs.
It allows the computer to help verify that your proof is correct.





## Project topics

For details, see the [About](about/) section.

1. Newton's theorem on real roots

2. Cauchy interlacing theorem

3. Puiseux's theorem

4. Descartes's rule of signs

5. Sturm's theorem for polynomial roots

6. Newton's theorem for valued fields
